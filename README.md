Borland colorscheme for Vim
===========================

The Borland colorscheme for Vim is a tribute to the classic IDE developed by Borland International Inc. in the early
1990'ties. It mimics the look of the interface and the syntax highlighting. It comes with two style variants: Modern and classic.

## Modern style

The modern style is the default. It has some colours changed slightly to make the code easier to read and to give the
scheme also a more modern look:

## Classic style

The class style can be activated by adding `let g:BorlandStyle = "classic"` to you config file. It uses exactly the same
colours as the original IDE:
